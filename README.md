# Things-Millenials-will-have-happen-in-their-lives

__This repo will contain collaborative articles__ on what we believe we will happen in our life times. We are Millenials, we are the first generation to grow up with household computer and other digital technology. As young adults we have changed society in profound ways and are witness to globalization with profound effects.  While it is hyperbole, it is not that much of a stretch to say our generation will determine the fate of the world. The world is warming due to fossil fuel consumption. Every environment and ecosystem on our planet is being heavily polluted with compounds and chemicals with unknown or devistating impacts. As other countries grow and consume they want the same lifestyles US citizens have and this is unsustainable. The space age has been reignited and new planets are being discovered on a daily basis. Nuclear proliferation is happening again. The world population is growing and people are livnig in places they shouldn't. And there is a generation of humans who will be inheriting this mess.
